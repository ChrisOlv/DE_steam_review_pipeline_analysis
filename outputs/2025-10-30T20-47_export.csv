2025-10-26,2025-10-26,english,"I really enjoy this game, especially for the price I purchased it at. I can't say that all the negative reviews are unfounded as the game does lack a bit of polish in some regards, but I will say that many of the negative claims are a bit exaggerated, such as how there is no counterplay. For example, the big-eyed enemies (I am aware of 2 so far) can be halted with a flashlight since they're sensitive to light. Bonking most things also stuns them for a good amount of time depending on what item you used, and you can often outrun them by going around corners as many have little object permanence (for better and for worse). Since I am recommending this game, though, I will focus primarily on the positive aspects that I believe make the game worthwhile. The biggest thing for me is that the restrictions placed upon the player make room for an astonishing amount of strategic depth despite the game's many mechanics that are, in fact, quite simple. For example, you can decide to make everyone shuttle pizzas and spread out to make deliveries, make just one person the pizza guy while others focus on exploring or head out to buy items, or make one person carry useful items like a bonk stick of some sort and a flashlight to provide support against the monsters for the other delivery guys. You may even want someone to venture out with a piggy bank to pick up money left behind by the delivery guys. Another big aspect that I haven't seen any game of this type do as well is the way the map evolves as you play. If you don't get very far, you may think the map is basically the same every day, but that is not the case. Almost every block on the map can have a different building between runs, but that's only the surface level changes. When you get far enough in a game, new areas will open up for you to explore, both in buildings and on the streets. This means that you can find more loot (many useful items, including money, can be looted from various points of interest). The map will get more dangerous to traverse not just because of more monsters being around, but because of collapsing roads, forcing you to take new, winding paths to your destinations. Not only does this add more strategic depth, but it also requires players to think on their feet more. While a collapsed road can sometimes get in the way, you may also be able to use it to avoid monsters. There's also information about the monsters to be found hidden throughout the map, some if it in areas only accessible later in the game, such as in the sewers. This is a game that can be quite punishing when you don't know much about it, but becomes far deeper and more rewarding as you play and gather information. While I understand much of where so many of the negative reviews are coming from, I do find many of them to be too hastily made. Everyone should at least try to get a run to reputation level 3 before leaving a review, in my opinion, because that's where you start to really understand what the game is and how to play it. I believe the furthest I've gotten so far is just barely to reputation 4 with 3 total players. In the end, however, you should look through all the reviews and come to your own decision about whether you wish to purchase the game or not. It's super inexpensive, though, so you have little to lose by trying it out. The biggest drawback is that it's the most fun with more players and, with the reviews as they are now, it may be difficult to get your friends into it without gifting it to them yourself.

If you don't get very far, you may think the map is basically the same every day, but that is not the case. Almost every block on the map can have a different building between runs, but that's only the surface level changes. When you get far enough in a game, new areas will open up for you to explore, both in buildings and on the streets. This means that you can find more loot (many useful items, including money, can be looted from various points of interest). The map will get more dangerous to traverse not just because of more monsters being around, but because of collapsing roads, forcing you to take new, winding paths to your destinations. Not only does this add more strategic depth, but it also requires players to think on their feet more. While a collapsed road can sometimes get in the way, you may also be able to use it to avoid monsters. 

There's also information about the monsters to be found hidden throughout the map, some if it in areas only accessible later in the game, such as in the sewers. This is a game that can be quite punishing when you don't know much about it, but becomes far deeper and more rewarding as you play and gather information. While I understand much of where so many of the negative reviews are coming from, I do find many of them to be  too hastily made. Everyone should at least try to get a run to reputation level 3 before leaving a review, in my opinion, because that's where you start to really understand what the game is and how to play it. I believe the furthest I've gotten so far is just barely to reputation 4 with 3 total players.

In the end, however, you should look through all the reviews and come to your own decision about whether you wish to purchase the game or not. It's super inexpensive, though, so you have little to lose by trying it out. The biggest drawback is that it's the most fun with more players and, with the reviews as they are now, it may be difficult to get your friends into it without gifting it to them yourself. The devs seem to really want to improve the game based on user feedback, though, so if you aren't comfortable purchasing it in its current state, I would highly recommend following it or adding it to your wishlist to check back later and see how it's grown.",207668667,0.5,76561198191639645

On the second day, there are weird eggs all around, and then on the third day, there is a monster that wasn't programmed to jump, so just standing on anything makes you untouchable. In a game where you NEED to be moving with no time to waste, AND the monster won't just walk off, you're just having a staring contest. If you can only take one more hit, tough luck, you're getting hit when you jump off that table.

Nothing feels like it meshes well; the items feel useless and rather cumbersome. You need people delivering pizzas, but if you have one guy buying items, they have to make multiple trips to get a certain amount of items AND one more to get your piggy bank again. There are no items you can eventually buy to make this process any less insufferable.

Lastly, I want to talk about the balance itself; it's just non-existent. Random ghost cars that can best be described as 'spammy' don't care about where you are. If you're in a building, you can bet your ass you're getting run over by a car through the walls.

Hard to recommend in its current state. Just very lacking in gameplay, which consists entirely of walking between doors and the pizzeria one pizza at a time. This is basically the entire game, and the map is tiny and mostly unchanging. Eventually monsters start spawning and my group at least couldn't figure out what you're supposed to do with them because your options for looping monsters DBD style are non-existent, some are just faster than you, and hitting them only stuns them for a second and is useless when there's more than one which there often is. Jumping on top of something only delays the inevitable. You can technically sneak but a lot of streets and alleys are too small to sneak through if there's a monster nearby because you can't make enough distance. We figured maybe we're supposed to break the obvious glowing monster eggs when we see them, but hitting them even once destroys whatever you have equipped, so that's not viable.\nIf you manage to actually get shit done, you can still lose if you're out past 12:00 because the fog gets you. How do you know when it's close to 12:00 if you aren't already back in the store? Fuck you. How do you communicate it's time to come back to anyone that happens to still be out? Fuck you unless they're already within earshot of the proximity chat.\nThe concept is there but there are no mechanics to prop it up and make it into a full experience. It's possible we were just missing something but the only loading screen tip is that people can't hear you during loading screens, which is pretty obvious when their voices cut out during loading screens.\nThere needs to be more to the game to really make it worth playing, and some QOL like a purchasable upgrade for your crew to know what time it is or how many pizzas have left to be delivered, a map with your people on it, etc. Having the gameplay loop extend beyond \"ok it's night 3 please die\" would go a long way, with maybe a slower build up and incremental upgrades, or even the option to set up some defenses around the map.\nThe idea is there, but I do think it needs work.", "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0.707241952419281, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1761380506, "timestamp_updated": 1761380506, "playtime_at_review": 0, "playtime_forever": 0, "author_num_games_owned": 742, "author_num_reviews": 46, "author_playtime_forever": 89, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "author_last_played": 1761377886}

Does smashing them stop the monsters from spawning? How do different monsters work? The pizza monster wiped out team out because he can’t be stunned and we have lost multiple runs to the car flying through buildings. It would be helpful to know be able to definitively discover how these entities work through a monster log or some other mechanic.\n\nAs far as other improvements go, the car needs a rework. It comes out of nowhere, can fly through buildings, and doesn’t give much notice. The carnival balloons are a nice anime reference and even though they are annoying, I could live with them. What I can’t live with is the pizza monster. He is silent, unstoppable, and fast. Encountering him is certain death and the restart after D5 is harsh.\n\nLastly, I’m not sure you can actually access some of the second floors that the game generates occasionally.

{"recommendationid": "207668667", "author_steamid": "76561198191639645", "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game, especially for the price I purchased it at. I can't say that all the negative reviews are unfounded as the game does lack a bit of polish in some regards, but I will say that many of the negative claims are a bit exaggerated, such as how there is no counterplay. For example, the big-eyed enemies (I am aware of 2 so far) can be halted with a flashlight since they're sensitive to light. Bonking most things also stuns them for a good amount of time depending on what item you used, and you can often outrun them by going around corners as many have little object permanence (for better and for worse).\n\nSince I am recommending this game, though, I will focus primarily on the positive aspects that I believe make the game worthwhile. The biggest thing for me is that the restrictions placed upon the player make room for an astonishing amount of strategic depth despite the game's many mechanics that are, in fact, quite simple. For example, you can decide to make everyone shuttle pizzas and spread out to make deliveries, make just one person the pizza guy while others focus on exploring or head out to buy items, or make one person carry useful items like a bonk stick of some sort and a flashlight to provide support against the monsters for the other delivery guys. You may even want someone to venture out with a piggy bank to pick up money left behind by the delivery guys. \n\nAnother big aspect that I haven't seen any game of this type do as well is the way the map evolves as you play. If you don't get very far, you may think the map is basically the same every day, but that is not the case. Almost every block on the map can have a different building between runs, but that's only the surface level changes. When you get far enough in a game, new areas will open up for you to explore, both in buildings and on the streets. This means that you can find more loot (many useful items, including money, can be looted from various points of interest). The map will get more dangerous to traverse not just because of more monsters being around, but because of collapsing roads, forcing you to take new, winding paths to your destinations. Not only does this add more strategic depth, but it also requires players to think on their feet more. While a collapsed road can sometimes get in the way, you may also be able to use it to avoid monsters. \n\nThere's also information about the monsters to be found hidden throughout the map, some if it in areas only accessible later in the game, such as in the sewers. This is a game that can be quite punishing when you don't know much about it, but becomes far deeper and more rewarding as you play and gather information. While I understand much of where so many of the negative reviews are coming from, I do find many of them to be  too hastily made. Everyone should at least try to get a run to reputation level 3 before leaving a review, in my opinion, because that's where you start to really understand what the game is and how to play it. I believe the furthest I've gotten so far is just barely to reputation 4 with 3 total players.\n\nIn the end, however, you should look through all the reviews and come to your own decision about whether you wish to purchase the game or not. It's super inexpensive, though, so you have little to lose by trying it out. The biggest drawback is that it's the most fun with more players and, with the reviews as they are now, it may be difficult to get your friends into it without gifting it to them yourself.

The changes to the Mascot are really good, creates a really good challenge without insta dying, seeing the coffee location on the map is FANTASTIC, The ghost cars still provide a little jump scare and fear of getting hit without it being extremely punishing, monsters no longer camp the cars and umbrellas you are on to get away from them, the balance of the egg spawns have been great (4 or 5 instead of like 10+ on day 2 or 3 is great and am looking forward to the difficulty levels rise with them as we progress). With these changes, the game definitely feels better to play, it still is a challenge that doesn't make the game feel easy or too punishing, and has been a lot more enjoyable to play!\n\nThere are a few things I would recommend the dev team to look into (I have some clips showing the occurrences and working to get more if they happen again:\n- Money and items disappearing at random (i.e. putting a pizza at a delivery spot, the hand of the model shows as if it's holding money but money is not visible, nor counts when \"being turned in\" and is not anywhere around the delivery spot\n- Items disappearing when someone DC's from the game (piggybank with over 1k in it at day 12 , a friend had DC'd and the piggybank disappeared from the pizza shop when no one was holding it when they DC'd, another friend's internet crashed and the basketball and sausage disappeared; they were not holding either item\n- Items reset when someone new loads into the game. I started the lobby, I took the basketball and sausage out of the lockers in the beginning and my friend's game took a while to load in and then they magically went back to the lockers and they took them out again and caused a bit of a \"lock\" with the basketball where we couldn't pick it up\n\nWhat my Wishlist would be for the game:\n- a new item added that can be purchased like a mini map and a watch to keep track of time\n- an upgrade that gives us a general area of where the zombie pods are (like a circle but doesn't give exact locations for them)\n- Save files! Before the balancing that the devs did, somehow the rng gave us a \"run\" where we managed to make it to day 14 before we all died and got fired. If we had made it past that day and decided to call it for the day, I would have loved to continue off that file where we didn't die/get fired and continue. \n\nThank you again Devs for taking feedback into consideration and you transparency!\n\nThank you for the awards as well on my review (pre-review change) <3\n\nSide note no one asked for, please do not only play 0.2 hours and downvote a game.

Hard to recommend in its current state. Just very lacking in gameplay, which consists entirely of walking between doors and the pizzeria one pizza at a time. This is basically the entire game, and the map is tiny and mostly unchanging. Eventually monsters start spawning and my group at least couldn't figure out what you're supposed to do with them because your options for looping monsters DBD style are non-existent, some are just faster than you, and hitting them only stuns them for a second and is useless when there's more than one which there often is. Jumping on top of something only delays the inevitable. You can technically sneak but a lot of streets and alleys are too small to sneak through if there's a monster nearby because you can't make enough distance. We figured maybe we're supposed to break the obvious glowing monster eggs when we see them, but hitting them even once destroys whatever you have equipped, so that's not viable.\nIf you manage to actually get shit done, you can still lose if you're out past 12:00 because the fog gets you. How do you know when it's close to 12:00 if you aren't already back in the store? Fuck you. How do you communicate it's time to come back to anyone that happens to still be out?

It does a great job of setting the atmosphere and the randomizations of the map, fog color, and enemies are all great. \n\nYou also nailed the default movement speed for \nthe player and the upgrades you get give appropriate increases for price.\n\nSome items that could use improvement however are mechanics: how do eggs work? Does smashing them stop the monsters from spawning? How do different monsters work? The pizza monster wiped out team out because he can’t be stunned and we have lost multiple runs to the car flying through buildings. It would be helpful to know be able to definitively discover how these entities work through a monster log or some other mechanic.\n\nAs far as other improvements go, the car needs a rework. It comes out of nowhere, can fly through buildings, and doesn’t give much notice. The carnival balloons are a nice anime reference and even though they are annoying, I could live with them. What I can’t live with is the pizza monster. He is silent, unstoppable, and fast. Encountering him is certain death and the restart after D5 is harsh.\n\nLastly, I’m not sure you can actually access some of the second floors that the game generates occasionally. There are a few ways onto the roofs we discovered, but some of them don’t seem possible.

{"recommendationid": "207668667", "author_steamid": "76561198191639645", "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game, especially for the price I purchased it at. I can't say that all the negative reviews are unfounded as the game does lack a bit of polish in some regards, but I will say that many of the negative claims are a bit exaggerated, such as how there is no counterplay. For example, the big-eyed enemies (I am aware of 2 so far) can be halted with a flashlight since they're sensitive to light. Bonking most things also stuns them for a good amount of time depending on what item you used, and you can often outrun them by going around corners as many have little object permanence (for better and for worse).\n\nSince I am recommending this game, though, I will focus primarily on the positive aspects that I believe make the game worthwhile. The biggest thing for me is that the restrictions placed upon the player make room for an astonishing amount of strategic depth despite the game's many mechanics that are, in fact, quite simple. For example, you can decide to make everyone shuttle pizzas and spread out to make deliveries, make just one person the pizza guy while others focus on exploring or head out to buy items, or make one person carry useful items like a bonk stick of some sort and a flashlight to provide support against the monsters for the other delivery guys. You may even want someone to venture out with a piggy bank to pick up money left behind by the delivery guys. \n\nAnother big aspect that I haven't seen any game of this type do as well is the way the map evolves as you play. If you don't get very far, you may think the map is basically the same every day, but that is not the case. Almost every block on the map can have a different building between runs, but that's only the surface level changes. When you get far enough in a game, new areas will open up for you to explore, both in buildings and on the streets. This means that you can find more loot (many useful items, including money, can be looted from various points of interest). The map will get more dangerous to traverse not just because of more monsters being around, but because of collapsing roads, forcing you to take new, winding paths to your destinations. Not only does this add more strategic depth, but it also requires players to think on their feet more. While a collapsed road can sometimes get in the way, you may also be able to use it to avoid monsters. \n\nThere's also information about the monsters to be found hidden throughout the map, some if it in areas only accessible later in the game, such as in the sewers. This is a game that can be quite punishing when you don't know much about it, but becomes far deeper and more rewarding as you play and gather information. While I understand much of where so many of the negative reviews are coming from, I do find many of them to be  too hastily made. Everyone should at least try to get a run to reputation level 3 before leaving a review, in my opinion, because that's where you start to really understand what the game is and how to play it. I believe the furthest I've gotten so far is just barely to reputation 4 with 3 total players.\n\nIn the end, however, you should look through all the reviews and come to your own decision about whether you wish to purchase the game or not. It's super inexpensive, though, so you have little to lose by trying it out. The biggest drawback is that it's the most fun with more players and, with the reviews as they are now, it may be difficult to get your friends into it without gifting it to them yourself.

The changes to the Mascot are really good, creates a really good challenge without insta dying, seeing the coffee location on the map is FANTASTIC, The ghost cars still provide a little jump scare and fear of getting hit without it being extremely punishing, monsters no longer camp the cars and umbrellas you are on to get away from them, the balance of the egg spawns have been great (4 or 5 instead of like 10+ on day 2 or 3 is great and am looking forward to the difficulty levels rise with them as we progress). With these changes, the game definitely feels better to play, it still is a challenge that doesn't make the game feel easy or too punishing, and has been a lot more enjoyable to play!\n\nThere are a few things I would recommend the dev team to look into (I have some clips showing the occurrences and working to get more if they happen again:\n- Money and items disappearing at random (i.e. putting a pizza at a delivery spot, the hand of the model shows as if it's holding money but money is not visible, nor counts when \"being turned in\" and is not anywhere around the delivery spot\n- Items disappearing when someone DC's from the game (piggybank with over 1k in it at day 12 , a friend had DC'd and the piggybank disappeared from the pizza shop when no one was holding it when they DC'd, another friend's internet crashed and the basketball and sausage disappeared; they were not holding either item\n- Items reset when someone new loads into the game. I started the lobby, I took the basketball and sausage out of the lockers in the beginning and my friend's game took a while to load in and then they magically went back to the lockers and they took them out again and caused a bit of a \"lock\" with the basketball where we couldn't pick it up\n\nWhat my Wishlist would be for the game:\n- a new item added that can be purchased like a mini map and a watch to keep track of time\n- an upgrade that gives us a general area of where the zombie pods are (like a circle but doesn't give exact locations for them)\n- Save files! Before the balancing that the devs did, somehow the rng gave us a \"run\" where we managed to make it to day 14 before we all died and got fired. If we had made it past that day and decided to call it for the day, I would have loved to continue off that file where we didn't die/get fired and continue. \n\nThank you again Devs for taking feedback into consideration and you transparency!\n\nThank you for the awards as well on my review (pre-review change) <3\n\nSide note no one asked for, please do not only play 0.2 hours and downvote a game.

{"date_created":1761350400000,"date_updated":1761350400000,"language":"english","llm_review_translated":"Another in the now long line of games I've labeled 'spooky chores,' where you do something that would be mind-numbingly boring in any other context but add monsters to it. Hard to recommend in its current state. Just very lacking in gameplay, which consists entirely of walking between doors and the pizzeria one pizza at a time. This is basically the entire game, and the map is tiny and mostly unchanging. Eventually, monsters start spawning and my group at least couldn't figure out what you're supposed to do with them because your options for looping monsters DBD style are non-existent, some are just faster than you, and hitting them only stuns them for a second and is useless when there's more than one which there often is. Jumping on top of something only delays the inevitable. You can technically sneak but a lot of streets and alleys are too small to sneak through if there's a monster nearby because you can't make enough distance. We figured maybe we're supposed to break the obvious glowing monster eggs when we see them, but hitting them even once destroys whatever you have equipped, so that's not viable. If you manage to actually get shit done, you can still lose if you're out past 12:00 because the fog gets you. How do you know when it's close to 12:00 if you aren't already back in the store? Fuck you. How do you communicate it's time to come back to anyone that happens to still be out? Fuck you unless they're already within earshot of the proximity chat. The concept is there but there are no mechanics to prop it up and make it into a full experience.

Hard to recommend in its current state. Just very lacking in gameplay, which consists entirely of walking between doors and the pizzeria one pizza at a time. This is basically the entire game, and the map is tiny and mostly unchanging. Eventually monsters start spawning and my group at least couldn't figure out what you're supposed to do with them because your options for looping monsters DBD style are non-existent, some are just faster than you, and hitting them only stuns them for a second and is useless when there's more than one which there often is. Jumping on top of something only delays the inevitable. You can technically sneak but a lot of streets and alleys are too small to sneak through if there's a monster nearby because you can't make enough distance. We figured maybe we're supposed to break the obvious glowing monster eggs when we see them, but hitting them even once destroys whatever you have equipped, so that's not viable.\nIf you manage to actually get shit done, you can still lose if you're out past 12:00 because the fog gets you. How do you know when it's close to 12:00 if you aren't already back in the store? Fuck you. How do you communicate it's time to come back to anyone that happens to still be out? Fuck you unless they're already within earshot of the proximity chat.\nThe concept is there but there are no mechanics to prop it up and make it into a full experience.

{"date_created":1761436800000,"date_updated":1761436800000,"language":"english","llm_review_translated":"I really enjoy this game, especially for the price I purchased it at. I can't say that all the negative reviews are unfounded as the game does lack a bit of polish in some regards, but I will say that many of the negative claims are a bit exaggerated, such as how there is no counterplay. For example, the big-eyed enemies (I am aware of 2 so far) can be halted with a flashlight since they're sensitive to light. Bonking most things also stuns them for a good amount of time depending on what item you used, and you can often outrun them by going around corners as many have little object permanence (for better and for worse). Since I am recommending this game, though, I will focus primarily on the positive aspects that I believe make the game worthwhile. The biggest thing for me is that the restrictions placed upon the player make room for an astonishing amount of strategic depth despite the game's many mechanics that are, in fact, quite simple. For example, you can decide to make everyone shuttle pizzas and spread out to make deliveries, make just one person the pizza guy while others focus on exploring or head out to buy items, or make one person carry useful items like a bonk stick of some sort and a flashlight to provide support against the monsters for the other delivery guys. You may even want someone to venture out with a piggy bank to pick up money left behind by the delivery guys. Another big aspect that I haven't seen any game of this type do as well is the way the map evolves as you play. If you don't get very far, you may think the map is basically the same every day, but that is not the case. Almost every block on the map can have a different building between runs, but that's only the surface level changes. When you get far enough in a game, new areas will open up for you to explore, both in buildings and on the streets. This means that you can find more loot (many useful items, including money, can be looted from various points of interest). The map will get more dangerous to traverse not just because of more monsters being around, but because of collapsing roads, forcing you to take new, winding paths to your destinations. Not only does this add more strategic depth, but it also requires players to think on their feet more. While a collapsed road can sometimes get in the way, you may also be able to use it to avoid monsters. There's also information about the monsters to be found hidden throughout the map, some if it in areas only accessible later in the game, such as in the sewers. This is a game that can be quite punishing when you don't know much about it, but becomes far deeper and more rewarding as you play and gather information. While I understand much of where so many of the negative reviews are coming from, I do find many of them to be too hastily made. Everyone should at least try to get a run to reputation level 3 before leaving a review, in my opinion, because that's where you start to really understand what the game is and how to play it. I believe the furthest I've gotten so far is just barely to reputation 4 with 3 total players. In the end, however, you should look through all the reviews and come to your own decision about whether you wish to purchase the game or not.

I can't say that all the negative reviews are unfounded as the game does lack a bit of polish in some regards, but I will say that many of the negative claims are a bit exaggerated, such as how there is no counterplay. For example, the big-eyed enemies (I am aware of 2 so far) can be halted with a flashlight since they're sensitive to light. Bonking most things also stuns them for a good amount of time depending on what item you used, and you can often outrun them by going around corners as many have little object permanence (for better and for worse).\n\nSince I am recommending this game, though, I will focus primarily on the positive aspects that I believe make the game worthwhile. The biggest thing for me is that the restrictions placed upon the player make room for an astonishing amount of strategic depth despite the game's many mechanics that are, in fact, quite simple. For example, you can decide to make everyone shuttle pizzas and spread out to make deliveries, make just one person the pizza guy while others focus on exploring or head out to buy items, or make one person carry useful items like a bonk stick of some sort and a flashlight to provide support against the monsters for the other delivery guys. You may even want someone to venture out with a piggy bank to pick up money left behind by the delivery guys. \n\nAnother big aspect that I haven't seen any game of this type do as well is the way the map evolves as you play. If you don't get very far, you may think the map is basically the same every day, but that is not the case. Almost every block on the map can have a different building between runs, but that's only the surface level changes. When you get far enough in a game, new areas will open up for you to explore, both in buildings and on the streets. This means that you can find more loot (many useful items, including money, can be looted from various points of interest). The map will get more dangerous to traverse not just because of more monsters being around, but because of collapsing roads, forcing you to take new, winding paths to your destinations. Not only does this add more strategic depth, but it also requires players to think on their feet more. While a collapsed road can sometimes get in the way, you may also be able to use it to avoid monsters. \n\nThere's also information about the monsters to be found hidden throughout the map, some if it in areas only accessible later in the game, such as in the sewers. This is a game that can be quite punishing when you don't know much about it, but becomes far deeper and more rewarding as you play and gather information. While I understand much of where so many of the negative reviews are coming from, I do find many of them to be  too hastily made. Everyone should at least try to get a run to reputation level 3 before leaving a review, in my opinion, because that's where you start to really understand what the game is and how to play it. I believe the furthest I've gotten so far is just barely to reputation 4 with 3 total players.\n\nIn the end, however, you should look through all the reviews and come to your own decision about whether you wish to purchase the game or not. It's super inexpensive, though, so you have little to lose by trying it out. The biggest drawback is that it's the most fun with more players and, with the reviews as they are now, it may be difficult to get your friends into it without gifting it to them yourself. The devs seem to really want to improve the game based on user feedback, though, so if you aren't comfortable purchasing it in its current state, I would highly recommend following it or adding it to your wishlist to check back later and see how it's grown.","recommendation_ID":"207668667","weighted_vote_score":0.5,"author_ID":"76561198191639645"}
